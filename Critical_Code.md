My project core pieces are simple and engaging, the randomized ghosts and heart collision keep the game dynamic ensuring that there are constant challenges. A main strength in the game is the scalability because new ghosts are added over time, making it challenging. However, what the user sees is quite minimal, which could make the game feel repetitive after a while. When I was first coding the game was handling collision detection to make sure there weren't laps between foxes and ghosts. If I wanted to further enhance my game I think improving the ghost behavior to make it more complex and predictable. I also think that visual and audio animations would be super cool, such as sound effects during collisions or power-ups would create an immersive experience. Furthermore, a game over screen and level progression would also be great features to enhance the user experiance. Introducing an option to adjust difficulty or new obstacles would give the user a stronger sense of accomplishment when they achieve their new high score. Finally, because of all the new additions that can make the game more fun for the user, my game would benefit from a complete rewrite. I think in the rewrite it would be important to have a smooth flawless collision system as well as incorporate some of my new ideas.
